# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022 

This Github repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges for the year 2022, written in the Go programming language.

Advent of Code is an annual event where a series of challenges are released throughout the month of December.
These challenges are self-contained puzzles that can be solved using a combination of programming and problem-solving skills.
